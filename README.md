# Adaptive-Kernel-based-Phase-Congruency-for-Geodesic-Active-Contour
From a Single Image, adaptive kernels are extracted and used for edge detection in Phase congruency for improving Geodesic active contour

My PhD topic is 'Adaptive Kernel framework for Active Mechanisms for Effective segmentation strategies'. As my research is getting published in an Inderscience joournal, I am sharing the code of extracting edge map using Phase congruency, such that anybody can use it for their research purpose.

The parameters of Phase congruency needs to be tuned as per the input.
