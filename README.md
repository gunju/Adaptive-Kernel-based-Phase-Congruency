# Adaptive-Kernel-based-Phase-Congruency-for-Geodesic-Active-Contour
From a Single Image, adaptive kernels are extracted and used for edge detection in Phase congruency for improving Geodesic active contour

My PhD topic is 'Adaptive Kernel framework for Active Mechanisms for Effective segmentation strategies'. As my research is getting published in an Inderscience joournal, I am sharing the code such that anybody can use it for their research purpose.
